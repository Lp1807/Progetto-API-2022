# Progetto-API-2022
Progetto Algoritmi e Principi di Informatica: WordChecker

Final project for "Algorithms and Principles of Computer Science" course at Politecnico di Milano

The purpose was to make a system that, at its heart, checks the matching between the letters of two words of equal length. The program is loosely inspired by the game Wordle.

Final Grade: 30/30 Cum Laude

Academic Year: 2021-2022

# Implementation

I have implemented a modified version of a **binary tree** where each node contains all the words from the vocabulary and has a "*next*" pointer that connects only the filtered words, in order to save memory space and to print all the filtered words without walking through the tree.

For the costraints I've used **matrixes**, **arrays** and **custom types**
